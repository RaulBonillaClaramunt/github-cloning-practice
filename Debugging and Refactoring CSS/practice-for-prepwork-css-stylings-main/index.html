            <h2>Feathers in the Wind</h2>
            <h3><em>A retelling of a European Jewish wisdom tale.</em></h3>

            <p>Once there was a man whom the entire village knew to be a gossip.<br>
                He could not wait to share the juiciest piece of gossip with<br>
                whoever would listen. It did not matter to him if the stories he<br>
                spread were true, or notâ€”he never stopped to ask.</p>
            <p>One day, after hearing the rabbi speak about the harm gossip<br>
                causes, this man went to the rabbi and said, "Rabbi, I am truly<br>
                sorry for all the pain I have caused with my loose lips. I<br>
                repent and will gossip no more. Can I be forgiven?"</p>
            <p>"Yes," replied the rabbi, "but here is what you must do. Go home.<br>
                Find a feather pillow. Open the pillow and release the feathers<br>
                on the wind. Then, come back to me."</p>
            <p>The man thought this a strange request, but he did as he was<br>
                told. When he came back, the rabbi said, "Now, go gather all the<br>
                feathers released from the pillow."</p>
            <p>"But that is impossible! They have flown all over the place. I do<br>
                not even know where most of them have traveled!"</p>
            <p>"So it is with words: you do know where your gossip and rumors<br>
                have traveled. Once words have been uttered, they cannot be<br>
                taken back."</p>
            <p>The man understood. From that day on, he was careful and<br>
                thoughtful when speaking of others, and spoke with<br>
                integrity.</p>
